# Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows, 4th Edition

This is the source code supplied on the companion CD-ROM with the book "Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows" the 4th edition. I'm not the author or the owner of this code, it's made by Microsoft and the author of the book Jeffrey Richter. I've decided to upload this code since most people by now will have lost their companion CD-ROM or some people might buy this book second hand without the CD-ROM being included. Having the source code is convient if you want to code along with the book since important files like the resource files are not always reproduced in text in the book itself. 

The source code is posted "as-is", these are Visual C++ 6 projects and you might not be able to open the workspace in any modern Visual Studio version. Some of the examples might not compile anymore or might not be the greatest idea to copy-paste into your production application.
